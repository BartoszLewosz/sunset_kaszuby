## Description

This is my project as a freelance activity. 

### What's behind?

To create this website I used WordPress.org and Motopress plugin. 


### Goal

Sunset Kaszuby is a start-up company of four entrepreneurs based in central Europe. They approached me at the beginning of their journey in the business of summer homes rental market. They made a request for a website with a  contact form as well as a reservation system that accepts online payments. After a series of discovery sessions, we collectively decided to use CMS (Content Management System).

### Challenges

Sunset Kaszuby is a family owned startup company with a little experience of technical environment. This meant that I had to take a lead in all of the processes of creating the website. Every decision we made on that project was gently explained and translated to basic terminology terms to firm owners. Another challenge was to research most common payment methods in the local market and set up secure payment with PayPal or credit/debit card.

### Role

I worked liaising with my main point of contact, two company directors, to manage the project in domain name, email marketing setup, UI/UX, payment gates, users administration and long term changes.

### Process

The very first step was researching the holiday homes rental market by analyzing that branch of the market. With my problem solving approach and consulting my observations with firm owners, I came out with solutions how we want to stand out, what are the strengths and weaknesses, and what are our advantages. I then started sketching the wire-frames of potential guests' reservation process.

### Design

As I agreed with my client about the choice of WordPress theme, I started to insert topic-related elements. My choice of colours represents the sunset. To improve accessibility, I set the contrast using a darker colour set of fonts. By changing some details in SVG files, I brought a more user friendly, welcoming interface of the website. 

### Outcome

The end result was a fully responsive website with a functional booking system that enables potential guests to make reservations and payments with ease.

### Next steps

While the all-year holiday homes are under construction, the booking website is ready for the business to launch in spring 2022. My role is:
  - to provide ongoing technical support
  - manage the website
  - Taking care of the technical part of the project
  - reviewing and improving the website
  - supporting non-tech business owners and employees

### What did I learn?

Working for Sunset Kaszuby from the very beginning of this project showed me how important it is to research and plan in advance. Seeing things from the customer's perspective  taught me how the subtle details contribute towards creating a user friendly website crucial for the business. Looking forward to continuing cooperate with Sunset Kaszuby.
