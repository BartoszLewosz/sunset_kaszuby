## Description

This is my **Portfolio**. I made it during online course **WTF - WhatTheFrontend** for practice.

### What's behind?

To create this website I used [gulp-starter-pack](https://github.com/maciejkorsan/wtf-gulp-starter#wtf-gulp-starter):

~~~~
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
gulp
~~~~

### Tools that I've used:

- VSCode
- SASS
- Fetch API
- CSS grid
- Figma
- git
- terminal

I followed the BEM standards and wrote my code as **clean** as possible.
